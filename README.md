<b>Technologies</b> :

The game developed using <b>CitrusEngine</b> which enables to use :

- <b>Box2d</b> : for the game physics which allowed us to implement a complex gameplay mechanisms  , one-way platform , moving platform , water bridge ..
- <b>Starling</b> / Stage3D : All Game graphic elements are rendered using Starling framework which gives better performance .
- <b>Signals</b> : using AS3 Signals rather then normal AS3 Event model .
- <b>Blitting</b> : we had a lot of animations due to the number of hero characters , and the enemies , so the blitting (generating spritesheets ) was the perfect solution to get the max in terms of performance
